## About

AlefAlefAlef is a group of ambitious, independent designers, whose passion for typography led each of us to seek out this virtual space. They craft their typefaces with a great deal of diligence, punctiliousness and thought, and each typeface was developed and fostered over time. The inspiration for many of their typefaces comes from unique associations such as architecture, mythology and children's books, while others were designed with an emphasis on functionality, for use as convenient and legible body text.
